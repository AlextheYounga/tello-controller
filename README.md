These scripts are not guaranteed to work with your drone. I have had to run extensive other tests to get any success with these scripts, some of which are not necessarily included in this project.
The Tello drone also has a tendency to just fail on certain commands for reasons that I cannot entirely determine. Sometimes it works perfectly, sometimes it doesn't.

I do know that lighting is a major factor. Your drone needs a ridiculous amount of light to function properly, as it needs light in order to run its built-in auto-positioning system.
I have to turn on literally every light in my house for the best results. Outside on a sunny day works best. 

I am still actively trying to improve these scripts.
